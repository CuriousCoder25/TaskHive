# 🐝 TaskHive – From Raw PHP to Laravel

TaskHive is a task management system built in two phases to demonstrate backend development progress and understanding.

- 🧱 `php-version` — A lightweight version built with **plain PHP** and **MySQL**, without any frameworks. Focused on core concepts like sessions, routing, and CRUD operations.
- 🚀 `laravel-version` — A fully-featured Laravel application with **Laravel Breeze**, **Livewire**, and **Bootstrap**. Designed to follow modern best practices and MVC architecture.

This project showcases how a simple idea can be built from scratch and then scaled using powerful frameworks like Laravel.

> 🌱 Ideal for self-learning, and comparing raw vs. structured development styles.

## 🤔 Why Two Versions?

Learning a framework is more meaningful when you understand what it's abstracting away.

- The `php-version` helps me build everything from scratch—routing, database connection, form handling, session logic.
- The `laravel-version` builds on that foundation, using Laravel's robust features to scale and organize the same functionality professionally.

This side-by-side evolution shows how much cleaner, faster, and secure development can become with modern tools—while still respecting the fundamentals.
